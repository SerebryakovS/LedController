Controlling RGB LED display with Allwinner H3
============================================================
This is a total hack of the Raspberry PI RGB Matrix Library.

A library to control commonly available 64x64, 32x32 or 16x32 RGB LED panels
with the Orange Pi PC.

Supports ONE CHAIN with many panels each.
